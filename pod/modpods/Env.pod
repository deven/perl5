=head1 NAME

Env - Perl module that imports environment variables

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl maintains environment variables in a pseudo-associative-array
named %ENV.  For when this access method is inconvenient, the Perl
module C<Env> allows environment variables to be treated as simple
variables.

The Env::import() function ties environment variables with suitable
names to global Perl variables with the same names.  By default it
does so with all existing environment variables (C<keys %ENV>).  If
the import function receives arguments, it takes them to be a list of
environment variables to tie; it's okay if they don't yet exist.

After an environment variable is tied, merely use it like a normal variable.
You may access its value 

    @path = split(/:/, $PATH);

or modify it

    $PATH .= ":.";

however you'd like.
To remove a tied environment variable from
the environment, assign it the undefined value

    undef $PATH;
