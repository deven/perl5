=head1 NAME

getcwd - get pathname of current working directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    require Cwd;
    $dir = Cwd::getcwd()'

    use Cwd;
    $dir = getcwd()'

    use Cwd 'chdir';
    chdir "/tmp";
    print $ENV{'PWD'};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The getcwd() function re-implements the getcwd(3) (or getwd(3)) functions
in Perl.  If you ask to override your chdir() built-in function, then your
PWD environment variable will be kept up to date.  (See
L<perlsub/Overriding builtin functions>.)

The fastgetcwd() function looks the same as getcwd(), but runs faster.
It's also more dangerous because you might conceivably chdir() out of a
directory that you can't chdir() back into.
